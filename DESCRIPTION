Package: EMMIX
Title: The EM Algorithm and Mixture Models
Description: Provides functions to fit finite mixture models. Components of the mixture models 
    can be of the normal distribution, t-distribution, skew normal distribution or skew t-distribution. 
    Maximum likelihood estimators of model parameters are obtained via the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Initial version of EMMIX was written in Fortran by David Peel(1999).
